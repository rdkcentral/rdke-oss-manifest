# RDKe - OSS Layer Manifests
This git repo will hold the OSS layer manifest(s) for generating OSS reference layer IPK.
OSS reference layer will be built onetime for a device and the IPKs of individual components will be kept in the corresponding artifactory location. 
All other layers (vendor,middleware and application) can consume the necessary IPK from artifactory
